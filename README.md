# Ice Blocks Puzzle Game

This game is inspired by sliding block puzzles in games like The Legend of Zelda. The player must push around sliding blocks to cover each goal square to win.

## Credits and Thanks
I started this project because I wanted to learn something new in software development. PyGame is a library that was fairly new to me, I wanted to create something interactive. I was able to do so thanks to tutorials online such as those from [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClearCode) and [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim). This game uses a font called "8-bitlimitobrk" from [Ã†nigma Fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/users/kentpw/)
